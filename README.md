# HPR-Trajectory-Code

Inside functions.py:

  Calculations.heights calculates the motor delay (coast time) and peak altitude of a one stage rocket
  This uses equations from: http://www.rocketmime.com/rockets/qref.html
  The validity of these equations is not confirmed

  Calculations.ODEints not completed atm
  Will complete a numerical intregation using forward Euler like that described in http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/systems/Lab_Notes/traj.pdf
